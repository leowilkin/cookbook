## Ingredients:

For the dough:

* 335mls warm milk
* 12g quick rise or active yeast
* 100g granulated sugar
* 2 eggs & 1 egg yolk
* 120g butter, melted
* 720g bread flour, plus more for dusting
* 1.5 teaspoons salt

For the filling:

* 240g dark brown sugar (light brown also works)
* 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
* 120g butter, softened

For the cream cheese frosting:

* 6 tablespoons butter, softened
* 150g powdered sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions:

1. Warm milk to around 44°C I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.
2. Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface.
3. Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and temperature in your home.
4. After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 36x23cm rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a 6.5mm margin at the far side of the dough.
5. In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter.
6. Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 23cm side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be.
7. Cut into 3cm sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces.
8. Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 23x23cm baking pan or round 23cm cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.
9. Preheat oven to 178°C. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting.
10. **To make the frosting:** In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve immediately.
