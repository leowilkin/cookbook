## Ingredients:

* 30g fresh/easy bake yeast
* 1kg strong white flour
* 20g salt
* 100g olive oil
* 640g water
* Plain white flour for dusting

## Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 250°C.
2. Rub all the yeast into the flour, using your fingertips as if making a crumble. Add the salt, olive oil, and water, then mix until no flour or water remains and then work the dough, to get as much air in it as possible. The dough should not be sticking to your hands after you have finished airating the dough.
3. Leave the dough to rest for 1 hour, or to achieve a better crust and taste, rest it overnight in the fridge. By doing this, you will enable the dough to rise very slowly and it will develop a little acidity that will improve the flavour and give a texture that is crispy on the outside and slightly chewy inside.
4. With the help of the rounded end of your scraper, turn out the dough, divide into six and shape into balls and rest for a further 10 minutes. Lightly flour your work surface and place the balls of dough onto the flour. You need to make sure that the flour is evenly distributed so that your pizzas will not stick.
5. Take one of the balls and place the heel of your hand in the centre of it and push it away from you so that it stretches the dough out. Turn the dough slightly and repeat. Keep stretching the dough until you have a roughly circular pizza shape of about 20-22 centimetres in diameter. The edge should be slightly thicker than the dough in the middle. Repeat with the other two balls.
6. Lift the pizza bases onto a floured baking tray and spread the tomato sauce evenly over them. Sprinkle with your toppings.
7. Slide the pizzas onto the preheated baking tray, or stone in the oven, turn the heat down to 240°C and bake for 10-12 minutes until the edges become golden brown and crispy.
